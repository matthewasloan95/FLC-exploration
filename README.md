# FLC-exploration
My quest to find and detect four leaf clovers from photos, a computer vision journey

# My goals to explore:
* Simple with yolo
    * Detection
    * Segmentation
* Resnet and variations
* more to come after I show these



I have added my packages and versions to environment yaml files for mac and linux ( If you're trying to recreate on windows I imagine it's largely the same as either, biggest difference is that my linux build has a gtx 1660)
``` $
 mamba env create -f environment_mac.yaml
```
